            Hozier's debut studio album is mainly a mix of blues, indie, and soul, and contains elements of folk, gospel, and R&B.
            Prior to its release, Hozier had released two EPs which attracted attention and songs from these EPs were included in the album. 
            Hozier began writing the songs in this album after a breakup because it forced him to reflect on what being loved meant.
