# Hozier Tribute
My project is a webpage about Hozier's first album. It includes the album cover, information about the creation of it, and the tracklist. It also has an embedded spotify player where the user can preview the songs listed. I created this webpage because this album has always been a source of comfort for me and I wanted to create a page where new fans can go to learn more. I have always been involved in fandom spaces and wanted to contribute to them. I made this project in Visual Studio Code and used HTML and CSS. I used an external CSS file so I had to link the two together. I used div containers to create the rectangles and gave them classes to edit them seperately in my CSS file. Inside the div tags, I used the heading tags, paragraph tag, and list tag. It was challenging because I have not used these languages in over 3 years and had to relearn many things. I struggled with fixing the position of elements on the page and making sure it worked for multiple screens. I learned many new things such as how to add new fonts, and overlap elements. I also learned how to embed audio on to a webpage.
